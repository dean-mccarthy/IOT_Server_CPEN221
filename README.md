# IOT Server

This server was a mini-project included in CPEN 221 - Software Construction I

The basic concept was to create a simulated IOT server where clients could interact with entities to send control requests or receive current info. 

The purpose of this project was to understand the Java server functions including:
   - IP and port assignments
   - Socket and ServerSocket usage
   - Transferring data streams

As well as getting comfortable with concurrency and thread-safe programming.
